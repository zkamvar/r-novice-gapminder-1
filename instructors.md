One or more paragraphs laying out the lesson's legend (i.e., the story
behind its running example).

## Overall

### Lesson materials: topics to move through quickly

One of the major challenges of the R lesson materials is the number
of topics compared to the Python materials (11 vs 6 topics). This is
because, in addition to the fundamental programming concepts, we 
also try to impart much more of the fundamentals of the R language 
itself. The rationale here is that novices will struggle with many
of the esoteric behaviours of R without a solid working knowledge of
The data structures in R. Topics [5 (data structures)](05-data-structures.html)
and [6 (subsetting)](06-data-subsetting.html) have a *lot* of content.
You should quickly, but comprehensively go through these lessons:
the idea is that attendees probably won't understand things at the
time, but hopefully later when they run into issues using R, their
memory will trigger. It may be helpful to state this.

You can also very quickly go through the [first lesson, introduction
to R and Rstudio](01-rstudio-intro.html)

### Whiteboard usage

There are a few concepts you may want to physically draw out on
a whiteboard:

 * Vector recycling


## Individual topics

### [Project management with RStudio](02-project-intro.html)

* The challenges in this lesson are designed to be follow-along. Get the
  attendees to follow as you type on-screen

### [Seeking help](04-seeking-help.html)

* Be sure to actually go through and example of an R help page. 
  Knowing how to read a help file is tremendously useful, and can
  be daunting if you've never seen one before.

* Be sure to show them CRAN Task views and go into one of the topics.
