One of the nice features of R is that most of its functions are vectorised,
that is the function will operate on all elements of a vector without
needing to loop through and act on each element one at a time. This makes
writing code more concise, easy to read, and less error prone.


```{r}
x <- 1:4
x * 2
```

The multiplication happened to each element of the vector.

We can also add two vectors together:

```{r}
y <- 6:9
x + y
```

Each element of `x` was added to its corresponding element of `y`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x:  1  2  3  4
    +  +  +  +
y:  6  7  8  9
---------------
    7  9 11 13
```

Comparison operators also apply element-wise, as we saw in the
subsetting lesson:

```{r}
x > 2
```

Logical operations are also vectorised:

```{r}
a <- x > 3
a
```

> `all()` will return `TRUE` if *all* elements of a vector are `TRUE`

Many functions also operate on element-wise on vectors:

```{r}
x <- 1:4
log(x)
```

Vectorised operations also work element wise on matrices:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m * -1
```
